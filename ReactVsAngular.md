# React vs Angular

Many people ask me the difference between angular and react, and what is best suits for their project.
That's why i decided to write this article

## App example

To demonstrate pros and cons of both technology i will make one project in both, and we will see, how technologies solve these issues
* Building process
* Caching problems (clear browser cache after every release)
* Event binding
* React propTypes vs TypeScript typed variables
* React Virtual DOM vs Angular Regular DOM
* React JSX vs Angular templates
* Redux global state vs Angular state

## Project Structure
```
-angular #direcotry with angular project
